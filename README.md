Code 1: Student Marks Lookup (Version 1)
Description:
This program stores the marks of students using a dictionary. It asks the user to enter a student’s name and then displays the corresponding marks if the student exists. If the student is not found, it displays an error message.

Features:
Uses a dictionary (student_marks) to map student names to their marks.

Takes input from the user (enter_name).

Uses an if-else condition to:

Retrieve and display marks if the name is found.

Show a "student not found" message if the name is missing.

Code 2: Student Marks Lookup (Version 2 – Duplicate)
Description:
This is a duplicate of Code 1, performing the same function:

Takes a student’s name as input and looks up their marks in a predefined dictionary.

Displays marks if the student is found, otherwise shows a “not found” message.

Note:
This code is identical to Code 1, so it performs the same logic and operations.

It may have been repeated for testing or practice purposes.

Code 3: List Slicing and Reversing
Description:
This program demonstrates basic list operations in Python:

It prints an original list of numbers from 1 to 10.

It extracts the first five elements using slicing.

It reverses the entire list using the slicing trick [::-1].

Features:
numbers[:5] → extracts first five elements from the list.

numbers[::-1] → returns a new list that is the reverse of the original.

All results are printed to the console.
